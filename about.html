                    <p class="mg-1">Hello! I am <b>Uladzislau</b>, you can call me <b>Ulad</b>. Glad to see you in my portfolio! Now I will tell you a little about myself.</p>
                    <p class="mg-1">I am a junior <b>full stack</b> developer, my tech stack is: <b>Python</b>/<b>Django</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>/<b>Vue</b>, <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>MySQL</b></p>
                    <p class="mg-1">
                        <b>On March 26, 2021,</b> I decided to start learning programming. I had little idea about programming, but since childhood I have been interested in computers and IT technologies, 
                        as a result of which programming has always attracted me
                    </p>
                    <p class="mg-1">I started my programming journey by learning <b>Python</b>. This is a very pleasant language for beginners, it helped me understand what programming is all about.</p>
                    <p class="mg-1">
                        I started with free courses and books, as well as educational videos on YouTube. From the very beginning, I studied the development of various projects, from game development using
                        <b>PyGame library</b>, to solving mathematical problems in some courses.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mg-1">
                        After learning the basics, I chose my path of becoming in programming and chose web development. Immediately after, I continued to study <b>Python</b>, 
                        but already on the backend side using the <b>Django framework</b>.
                    </p>        
                    <p class="mg-1">
                        From now on, I will only focus on back-end web development with <b>Django</b>. I studied and tried to create something. 
                        At first it was very unclear how it works and how to write it to make it work. But, over time, I began to notice that I was becoming more and more <b>competent</b>. 
                        I started my training with at least an hour a day, at the very beginning I got 3 hours a day, but not always, then I began to increase this value, 
                        from one hour a day to three, and after - up to 5-6 hours a day.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mg-1">
                        Over time, I <b>fell in love</b> with web development and programming in general, 
                        I was very interested in learning something new in this direction, as a result of which I realized that I want to connect my <b>life</b> with programming <b>forever</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mg-1">
                        With the passage of time, I realized that development on the server side alone was <b>not enough</b> for me, 
                        I wanted to make the functionality I made look beautiful, so I began to delve into <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mg-1">
                        After <b>564 days</b> of training, I am confident in my abilities and <b>ready</b> to get my first <b>job</b> 
                        as a web developer, ready to <b>create</b> and develop my <b>skills</b> in this direction, and also ready to make life <b>easier</b> for other <b>people</b>, 
                        thanks to the <b>products</b> in the development of which I will <b>participate</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mg-1 glitch"><b>See you soon!</b></p>
